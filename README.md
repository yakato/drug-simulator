#Drug Simulator
My first Android App, wrote on Android Study Jam GDG, Warsaw 11-12 March 2016.
Application indicating users how drugs affects on their perception. For now can display only information. In the near future: when you press the "Try it" button, you'll get an image from your camera with filters simulating the drug.
